# keep-alive-server

Hey guys:wave:!

There is a challenge:mechanic:!

That app is hosted on Render.

And that hoster has a peculiarity:

after 15-20 minutes of server's inactivity the images are disappearing, because server is 

going into a sleep mode, and images are keeping in temp folder.

So if someone has a script the server ping itself every 10 minutes it would be Very Appreciated:heart:.

Or recommend some good educational tutorial how to encode images directly into MongoDB.

Thank you in advance for any ideas :sunglasses::+1:
