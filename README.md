# keep-alive-server

Hey guys:wave:!

There is a challenge:mechanic:!

That app is hosted on Render.

And that hoster has a peculiarity:

after 15-20 minutes of server's inactivity the images are disappearing, because server is 

going into a sleep mode, and images are keeping in temp folder.

So if someone has a script the server ping itself every 10 minutes it would be Very Appreciated:heart:.

Or recommend some good educational tutorial how to encode images directly into MongoDB.

Thank you in advance for any ideas :sunglasses::+1:

The challenge is Solved:raising_hand:!

Thanks to that amazing article from Nearly Perfect Mediocracy

And this is a source code:

That's amazing, guys!

That's REALLY amazing:sunglasses:!

Four servers are spinning simultaneously!

Again! FOUR servers, guys!!!

One server is on Railway, to ping that Second one on Render with Back-End, -

"Do not sleep lazy azz":joy:!

The Third one keeps the Database.

And the Fourth one is spinning a Front-End!

Four servers to run one app!

Unbelievable!  Just Unbelievable!

The Microverse community is Sooo Inspiring:fireworks:!!!

Thank you, guys! You are amazing:heart:!
